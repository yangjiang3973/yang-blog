I prepared a keynote for this meeting, but I found it is really inconvient to do the demo in browser

and show the slides at the same time.

So I may ignore the keynote and focus on demo.

At the end, I will send the keynote to M's emailbox.

If you are interested, you could ask for it.

# introduction

I will make the demo short, because most features are quite simple and straight-forward.

Nobody would teach you how to use tiktok, but after you play with it directly, you can play for a whole day.

I will give you a general picture about features that teachers may frequently use.

If I feel one featuer may be important, I will switch to the demo site to show you.

By the way, before officil release, I host the demo site on my personal server:

# structure

## upload content

A course is just a space that teachers can upload learning resources and activities for students.

In most cases, admin should have already designed and created the course struc,

teachers only need to upload course content.

[demo:

if you want to add anything to your course, first you need to `turn the editing on`, on the top-right corner.

A lot of small icons will show up. You know the meaning once you see it.

for eample....edit..cross..DnD

each section has a button: `Add AN ACTIVITY OR RESOURCES`

then you will see an activity or resource picker.

It is really boring to show and explain them one by one.

Especially most of them are as easy as tiktok.

[click the fav button and `i` icon]

Later, I may pick some commen types to demo.

[hide one section]

once everything's done, you can preview this page as a student.
