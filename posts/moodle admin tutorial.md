So much for the video of front page custamization. See you in the next week's section!

# video 2

Welcome to the second video lesson.

In this lesson, I will show you basic operations about course management.

[click Site administration button]

go to site settings, this time, choose course tab, and then click Manage courses and categories.

You can create, edit, sort or delete categories and courses on this page.

settings about categories management are on the left column, other courses related settings are on the right.

first, let's try to create a new category.

[click create new category]

structure of categories can grow like a tree. You can create a multi-level structure.

but now we only want to create a new one on the top level.

so there is no parent

[delete parent category] [select top]

there are many ways to design categories structure.

base on relevance or timeline

I want to make all winter courses under this category, so I will call it `winter term`

[type winter term]

If you do not know the purpose of one option, you can click the question mark.

[click question mark]

so you know the id is not necessary now, just leave it empty.

[type `All courses starting from 2022.11.01 to 2023.02.01`]

That's all we need to create a category, very simple!

[click save]

now you see, we have a new category.

---

This new category is empty, we need to create a new course in it.

[click create course button]

There are many settings for a course, if you do not know any option, also click the `question mark`

[click one question mark]

then you will see an explanation.

For example, let's name this course as `Economics`,

short name as ECO100

you can choose start and end date according to your actual course timeline.

for example, here I set nov 1 and march 1.

then for the summary, you need to make a short introduction and upload an cover image
[input course summary: An entry level class for students who are interested in economics!]
[choose cover image ]

so far, we've completed the basic settings.

one more thing I want to show here is the course format.

[click format]

There are 4 differnt formats you can see here.

Usually, you can make your course in a weekly format.

Then the course will be split into sections based on weeks.

If you just have a few sections, it is ok to display all sections on the same page.

but now we have 18 sections, so it is better to show only one section per page.

for other settings, I just keep the default ones. and you can click the quesstion mark to know more details.

[click role renaming]

You can rename each role in this course.

For example, if this is a university course, we oftern call `teacher` as `lecturer`

[input lecturer]

Ok, all basic settings for a course are completed. Let's save it.

[click save and display]

we jump to the course page now.

on the left side, you can see the navigation column got some new content now.

such as, participants, and sections.

[click general and ]

each section has a seperate page.

but now, there is no content in any section.

You just created an empty course and also a category.

As admin, your job is to design and make the structure of all courses.

It is teacher's responsibility to upload course content and manage enrolled students.

I will explain how to to do this in a new tutorial for teachers.

Go back the course setting, you can edit again by clicking the gear button.
[click site admin button]

If you do not want to keep this course, just delete it.

So far, we have learned how to create, set and delete a course.

In the next video, I will talk about how to manage users on this site.

# video 3

Hello, welcome back!

Today's topic is very important. It's about users management on this site.

you need to carefully consider the settings for users and guests.

otherwise you may receive a lot of complaints.

First, I will show you 2 ways to add users to our site.

The most basic method is to create new user accounts manually

go to site administration and select users tab

[click site administration -> select users tab]
[click browse list of users]

here you can see all user accounts.

you can manage each account by clicking the edit button or delete button.

at the bottom, you can click add a new user here

[click `add a new user`]

You need to input user's information one this page.
[input username: `demo_student001`]

for the password, there is a decision you need to make here.

which way to generate password?

you could create a password for the new user or by yourself generate it automatically and let the user change later?

for demo or testing purpose, I just directly input the password `Qien666~(tilde)`
[input password]

[input first name and others
John
Demo
]

For other personal information, you do not need to complete right now.

You can let the new user finish it by himself.

for example, later, ask him to upload a user picture.

[click save button]

see, the new user is in the list now.

you can delete it at any time because you are the admin.

you can do anything here.

---

[back to home page]
In the furure, if you want to make this site more public and new users need to register by themselves,

you can enable `self-rgistration`

[click login button]

right now, there is not `register` button on the login page.

I will show you how to change the settings to allow users to register.

go to site administration -> plugins -> authentication -> Manage authentication.

you can see many plugins about authentication, and you just need to enable `Email-based self-registration` plugin.

In addition, do not forget to scroll down to change the settings.

[enable it]

[click save and logout]

save and logout

[login]

see the login page now, there is a new block to create an account!

# how to sign up to a course?

now, a user has an account to login to this site.

next, he need to get access to courses.

it's admin's job to make a user as a student or teacher in a course.

I will also introduce 2 ways to enrol into a course.

1. you can manually add users to a course and assign them the role they need.

How to do this? go to the course page

[dashbord -> select course]

and select paticipants on the left side

navigation column.

on this page, you can see a list of users in this course.

click `enrol user` to add a new guy.

[click enrol user]

in this small window, you can select the account you want to add, and assign the role to it.

such as teacher or student.

[click show more]

click show more, you can see more options to control enrolment.

such as enrolment duration.

[click save]

see, new the new user is in this course as a student.

2. you can also allow learners enrol to a course by themselves.

click the gear icon on the top right corner, choose `enrolment methods`

[click gear icon]

by default, `self enrolment` is disabled, you need to click the `eye` button to enable it.

now, learners can join this course by themselves.

if you need more advanced control over 'self enrolment', you can click the gear button.

[click gear button]

on this page, you can see more settings, such as `enrolment key`.

It means learners need to know this key, which may be a short word, before joining the course.

Other settings are pretty straightforward. I won't show them one by one.

click the question mark if you do not understand.

click `save`

now students can join this course by themselves.

ok, that's all for todays's topic.

You have learned all basic operations and almost completed this course.

site backup?? should I include this part?
or is there a quick way, like make s snapshot of server? diff between snapshot and backup?
PS: do not include this part. only I need to know.
make a snapshot and keep overwrite the old ones.
only when make important changes or immigration, then need to backup

0. TODO: course template!!!!

bulk upload can set default course values!

category id is on the url link when you click it!

course template is actually implemented by using other features:
https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Adding_a_new_course#Course_templates

write a document for this! copy from moodle doc!

1. course backup and restore

since you are a teacher, you do not have the permission to copy and save student's info.

if you want to save everything, ask the admin to do it for you.

restore: add as a new course or merge into an existing course

2. copy course

PS: i need to implement Cron....
make Cron run every minute
The scheduled task asynchronous_copy_task is enabled

3. forum

# video script:

Welcome back!

In this video,

I am going to show you a new feature that can help you save a lot of time when createing many, many courses.

first, you need to prepare a .csv file that includes necessary information of new courses.

I have a file in my local machine.

The first line shows the fields name, such as shortname, fullname and category.

follow the order of fields name, I input 5 courses' information.

Note, the catagary field is different. you should not use the category name literally.

instead, you should use category id.

Where to find it?

go to site administration, courses, manage courses and categories.

click the category, then at the end of url, you will see the category id

[click and show the category id]

Next, you need to upload this csv file to create new courses on the platform.

go to site administration, courses, upload courses.

select the csv file and click preview.

Here you can see the list of new courses you are going to create.

# template

and there are 2 useful features I want to share with you.

first, you can use a template for these new courses you are creating.

[click question mark]

this feature is under `course process`.

Detailed instructions for template are in the pdf file I uploaded.

second, you can add default course values.

In the csv file, we only set 3 necessary fields, shortname, fullname and category.

here you can set other default values for new courses.

finally, click `upload courses`

Now go back to the courses list, you can see new courses were created.

By using this feature, you can easily create new courses in bulk with a template.

# backup

The next feature I am going to introduce is called `backup`.

You can save a course as a file. Later restore it back to any platform based on moodle or even use it as a template.

Go to the course page and click the gear button.

click backup

[click backup]

there are 5 steps to complete backup.

Because I am the admin, so I can save all things under this course.

but for example, if you are a teacher, by default you don't have the permission to copy and save student's info.

continue, I decide to save everything.

[click next button]

the file is in .mbz format.

so you can share it with other platforms that are also based on moodle framework.

Later I will show you how to restore a course from a .mbz format file.

now, review the settings and perform backup.

one copy is saved on the server and also, you can download to your local machine.

in the future, you can restore this course at any time.

go to Site administration -> courses -> restore course

here you can restore from the file you have.

I also uploaded a pdf file about backup and restore. Make sure you read it after watching this video.

So much for course back and restore. see you!

# launch!

1. use amazon cloud service or domestic server?

(DONE) use vultr

2. (DONE) try Cron or other setting on demo server first.

    run `/usr/bin/php /path/to/moodle/admin/cli/cron.php >/dev/null` to enable cron for moodle

    the above command will only run once, you need to use crontab to run this command regularly!!

    move `/usr/bin/php /path/to/moodle/admin/cli/cron.php >/dev/null` to a crontab file and run every minute

    `crontab -u apache -e`

3. (IN PROGRESS) is there any article about moodle release on vps? including more details to take care.

reading moodle docs about installing...

`https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Installing_Moodle`

4. backup the site?(especially before any change). use instance snapshot or other methods?

what is snopshot and how to use it?

three things to backup:

    a. moodledata folder.
    b. MySQL DB
    c. moodle code(optional if no changes in code)

write a script to regularly backup? or make a tool to ask admin to backup? like install `Adminer`
https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Adminer

both, first backup the current moodle on my server and move to vultr's new server.

and write down the workflow.

5. prevent server from random login trials and maybe more protection

and other security settings

`The best security strategy is a good backup! But you don't have a good backup unless you are able to restore it. Test your restoration procedures!`

`Use https to secure all pages (not just the login page)`

6. Check mail works
