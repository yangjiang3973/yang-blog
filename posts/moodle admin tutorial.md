So much for the video of front page custamization. See you in the next week's section!

# video 2

Welcome to the second video lesson.

In this lesson, I will show you basic operations about course management.

[click Site administration button]

go to site settings, this time, choose course tab, and then click Manage courses and categories.

You can create, edit, sort or delete categories and courses on this page.

settings about categories management are on the left column, other courses related settings are on the right.

first, let's try to create a new category.

[click create new category]

structure of categories can grow like a tree. You can create a multi-level structure.

but now we only want to create a new one on the top level.

so there is no parent

[delete parent category] [select top]

there are many ways to design categories structure.

base on relevance or timeline

I want to make all winter courses under this category, so I will call it `winter term`

[type winter term]

If you do not know the purpose of one option, you can click the question mark.

[click question mark]

so you know the id is not necessary now, just leave it empty.

[type `All courses starting from 2022.11.01 to 2023.02.01`]

That's all we need to create a category, very simple!

[click save]

now you see, we have a new category.

---

This new category is empty, we need to create a new course in it.

[click create course button]

There are many settings for a course, if you do not know any option, also click the `question mark`

[click one question mark]

then you will see an explanation.

For example, let's name this course as `Economics`,

short name as ECO100

you can choose start and end date according to your actual course timeline.

for example, here I set nov 1 and march 1.

then for the summary, you need to make a short introduction and upload an cover image
[input course summary: An entry level class for students who are interested in economics!]
[choose cover image ]

so far, we've completed the basic settings.

one more thing I want to show here is the course format.

[click format]

There are 4 differnt formats you can see here.

Usually, you can make your course in a weekly format.

Then the course will be split into sections based on weeks.

If you just have a few sections, it is ok to display all sections on the same page.

but now we have 18 sections, so it is better to show only one section per page.

for other settings, I just keep the default ones. and you can click the quesstion mark to know more details.

[click role renaming]

You can rename each role in this course.

For example, if this is a university course, we oftern call `teacher` as `lecturer`

[input lecturer]

Ok, all basic settings for a course are completed. Let's save it.

[click save and display]

we jump to the course page now.

on the left side, you can see the navigation column got some new content now.

such as, participants, and sections.

[click general and ]

each section has a seperate page.

but now, there is no content in any section.

You just created an empty course and also a category.

As admin, your job is to design and make the structure of all courses.

It is teacher's responsibility to upload course content and manage enrolled students.

I will explain how to to do this in a new tutorial for teachers.

Go back the course setting, you can edit again by clicking the gear button.
[click site admin button]

If you do not want to keep this course, just delete it.

So far, we have learned how to create, set and delete a course.

In the next video, I will talk about how to manage users on this site.

Hello, welcome back!

Today's topic is very important. It's about users management on this site.

you need to carefully consider the settings for users and guests.

otherwise you may receive a lot of complaints.

First, I will show you 2 ways to add users to our site.

The most basic method is to create new user accounts manually

go to site administration and select users tab

[click site administration -> select users tab]
[click browse list of users]

here you can see all user accounts.

you can manage each account by clicking the edit button or delete button.

at the bottom, you can click add a new user here

[click `add a new user`]

You need to input user's information one this page.
[input username: `demo_student001`]

for the password, there is a decision you need to make here.

which way to generate password?

you could create a password for the new user or by yourself generate it automatically and let the user change later?

for demo or testing purpose, I just directly input the password `Qien666~(tilde)`
[input password]

[input first name and others
John
Demo
]

For other personal information, you do not need to complete right now.

You can let the new user finish it by himself.

for example, later, ask him to upload a user picture.

[click save button]

see, the new user is in the list now.

you can delete it at any time because you are the admin.

you can do anything here.

---

[back to home page]
In the furure, if you want to make this site more public and new users need to register by themselves,

you can enable `self-rgistration`

[click login button]

right now, there is not `register` button on the login page.

I will show you how to change the settings to allow users to register.

go to site administration -> plugins -> authentication -> Manage authentication.

you can see many plugins about authentication, and you just need to enable `Email-based self-registration` plugin.

In addition, do not forget to scroll down to change the settings.

[enable it]

[click save and logout]

save and logout

[login]

see the login page now, there is a new block to create an account!

# how to sign up to a course?

now, a user has an account to login to this site.

next, he need to get access to courses.

it's admin's job to make a user as a student or teacher in a course.

I will also introduce 2 ways to enrol into a course.

1. you can manually add users to a course and assign them the role they need.

How to do this? go to the course page

[dashbord -> select course]

and select paticipants on the left side

navigation column.

on this page, you can see a list of users in this course.

click `enrol user` to add a new guy.

[click enrol user]

in this small window, you can select the account you want to add, and assign the role to it.

such as teacher or student.

[click show more]

click show more, you can see more options to control enrolment.

such as enrolment duration.

[click save]

see, new the new user is in this course as a student.

2. you can also allow learners enrol to a course by themselves.

click the gear icon on the top right corner, choose `enrolment methods`

[click gear icon]

by default, `self enrolment` is disabled, you need to click the `eye` button to enable it.

now, learners can join this course by themselves.

if you need more advanced control over 'self enrolment', you can click the gear button.

[click gear button]

on this page, you can see more settings, such as `enrolment key`.

It means learners need to know this key, which may be a short word, before joining the course.

Other settings are pretty straightforward. I won't show them one by one.

click the question mark if you do not understand.

click `save`

now students can join this course by themselves.

ok, that's all for todays's topic.

You have learned all basic operations and almost completed this course.
